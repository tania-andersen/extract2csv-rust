# Extract2csv

Extract2csv is a simple and easy command line tool for extracting text patterns from files to a comma separated file (csv).

## Example

Letâ€™s say you have a folder with a lot of text files, extracted from pdf or Word documents with same text patterns. This command:

```sh
extract2csv "Time of reporting*Reference number" "company name*Dept" "Describe the event*Where did the event physically occur"
```
will extract the text where the asterisk * is into a csv-file named out.csv.

The file name is in column one and the extracted text in the following columns, when out.csv is viewed in a spreadsheet application:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|2019-442-2007.txt|march 15, 2019|GREVE MUNICIPALITY|A municipal employee, in the event of a change of job between two municipalities, has inadvertently not been deprived of his rights...|
|2019-442-2721.txt|may 15, 2019|GLADSAXE MUNICIPALITY|A citizen calls and says they can see a paycheck on an employee...|
|2019-442-4934.txt|november 5, 2019|Nordfyns Municipality|Users have viewed profile pictures that have not had the necessary consent to display...|

The example is from Danish FOI documents regarding data breaches.

You can have as many search patterns as you want to.

## Tips

Extract2csv can only read text files, but you can use command line tools such as [pdftotext, doc2txt et al](https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). to extract text from pdf, Word and other formats.

On Linux and Windows with WSL, you can extract all pdf files in a folder with this command:
```sh
for file in *.pdf; do pdftotext "$file"
```
